      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p>At Zappos.com, Our purpose is simple:to live and diliver WOW</p>
      <p>
        Twenty years ago, we began as a small online retailer that only sold
        shoes. Todat,we still sell shoes-as well as clothing,
        handbags,accessories, and more.That "more" is providing the very best
        customer service, customer experience, and company culture.We aim to
        inspire the world by showing it's possible to simultaneously deliver
        hapiness to customers, employees,vendors, shareholders, and the
        community ina long-term sustainable way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope that in the future people won't even realize we started selling
        shoes online. Instead, they'll know Zappos as a service <br /> company
        that just happened to sell__.
